# PCA_Data

MQ series sensors are being put together to behave as an electronic nose
From the specification sheet the response curve towards some common gas such as alcohol, CO, CO2, methane and etc are listed by the sensor manufacturer
We use an example code from Stat Quest to run Principal Component Analysis in Python
First task is to format the MQ data so it is compatible with the sample code.
